# Windows-Audio-Device-Switcher
Solves the Windows issue where changing the default audio device doesn't update the default communication device (affecting apps like Discord). This PowerShell script allows setting both, toggling between two configurable setups, and provides sound feedback. Designed for PowerToys integration.
